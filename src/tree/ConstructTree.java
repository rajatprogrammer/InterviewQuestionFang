/*Hi This is my first interview at amazon i have been preparing for amazon since last 6 Month .
//amazon
The interview consist of only 1 coding question as this is the phone screening test

Q.There is a network router which recive a continuos stream of packet at each second

let say at t0= 4
at t1= 87
at t2=32

after certain interval every time a querry is fired on this stream let say k=40 at t3 so the program have to return count of smallest value so output is 2 =[4,32] .

at t4=17
at t5=20
at t6=100
at t7== a query is fired where k=50 output= 4 as [32,4,17,20] these timestamp value is smallest then querry.

Point To Note
1.Production Read code
2.Handle all edge cases

Your solution querry computing time is equal to O(log(n)) and your insertion time is also O(log n). and don't used any sorting on whole data
