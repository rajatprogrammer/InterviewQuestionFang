 * 
 *         Add to List
 * 
 *         Share Given an array of integers arr and an integer target.
 * 
 *         You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with sum
 *         equal target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an
 *         answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.
 * 
 *         Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays,
 *         or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *         Example 1:
 * 
 *         Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: Only two
 *         sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
 *         Example 2:
 * 
 *         Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7 Output: 2 Explanation: Although we
 *         have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and
 *         [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of
 *         their lengths is 2. Example 3:
 * 
 *         Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6 Output: -1 Explanation: We
 *         have only one sub-array of sum = 6. Example 4:
 * 
 *         Input: arr = [5,5,4,4,5], target = 3 Output: -1 Explanation: We
 *         cannot find a sub-array of sum = 3. Example 5:
 * 
 *         Input: arr = [3,1,1,1,5,1,2,1], target = 3 Output: 3 Explanation:
 *         Note that sub-arrays [1,2] and [2,1] cannot be an answer because they
 *         overlap.
